#  Description:
#
# This is an if-up.d script to create natfree nework interface when bringing up network
# The script by itself, creates interface (if needed) without configuration.
# This script also checks for the availability of "natfree-server" configuration tool.
# If this configuration tool is available (like in a wired natfree lliurex server)
# "natfree-server update" is executed to configure the interface.
